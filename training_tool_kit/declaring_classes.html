class MyClass {
    // field, constructor, and 
    // method declarations
}
This is a class declaration. The class body (the area between the braces) contains all the code that provides for the life cycle of the objects created from the class: constructors for initializing new objects, declarations for the fields that provide the state of the class and its objects, and methods to implement the behavior of the class and its objects.

The preceding class declaration is a minimal one. It contains only those components of a class declaration that are required. You can provide more information about the class, such as the name of its superclass, whether it implements any interfaces, and so on, at the start of the class declaration. For example,

class MyClass extends MySuperClass implements YourInterface {
    // field, constructor, and
    // method declarations
}
means that MyClass is a subclass of MySuperClass and that it implements the YourInterface interface.</pre></div><br /><hr><br /><form class="code" action="http://10.42.12.234:6002/test/servlet/ControllerServlet" method="post" target="_blank"><textarea  readonly="readonly" style="width:100%;height:100px;" name="code">//sample code for declaring classes
