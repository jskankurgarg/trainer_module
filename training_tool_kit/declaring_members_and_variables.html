Member variables in a class—these are called fields.
Variables in a method or block of code—these are called local variables.
Variables in method declarations—these are called parameters.

The Bicycle class uses the following lines of code to define its fields:
public int cadence;
public int gear;
public int speed;
Field declarations are composed of three components, in order:

Zero or more modifiers, such as public or private.
The field's type.
The field's name.
The fields of Bicycle are named cadence, gear, and speed and are all of data type integer (int). 
The public keyword identifies these fields as public members, accessible by any object that can access the class.</pre></div><br /><hr><br />
